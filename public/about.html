<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Ricardo — a 19-year-old web developer with a passion for creating modern, responsive, and user-focused 
  websites and web applications.
   I specialize in both front-end and back-end development, and I love bringing ideas to life through clean,
    efficient code and beautiful design.</p>

<p>My journey into web development began out of curiosity and quickly grew into a deep interest in technology and problem-solving. Over time, 
  I’ve built projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.
   I’m also expanding my skills in backend technologies like Node.js, Express, 
  and working with databases such as MongoDB and MySQL.</p>

<p>I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and take on new challenges. 
  Whether it’s a personal project, a freelance gig, or a team effort, I enjoy contributing to something meaningful.
   My goal is to grow as a full-stack developer and use my skills to build digital products that make a real impact.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring tech trends, learning new tools, 
and connecting with other developers to share ideas and grow together.
